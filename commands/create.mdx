description: Create a new draft email locally
---

The `create` command generates a new draft email file with proper frontmatter and structure.

## Usage

```bash
buttondown create --title="Your Email Title" [options]
```

## Basic Example

```bash
$ buttondown create --title="Welcome to my newsletter"
Created new draft email: ./buttondown/emails/welcome-to-my-newsletter.md
```

## Options

<ParamField path="--title" type="string" shorthand="-t" required>
  The title/subject of your new email.
  
  This will be used as the email subject and to generate the filename slug.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--directory" type="string" shorthand="-d" default="./buttondown">
  The directory where the email will be created.
  
  The email file will be created in the `emails/` subdirectory. If the directory doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.
</ParamField>

## Generated File Structure

The command creates a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
subject: Welcome to my newsletter
status: draft
email_type: public
slug: welcome-to-my-newsletter
created: 2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z
modified: 2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z
---

Write your email content here...
```

### Frontmatter Fields

- **subject** - The email title you provided
- **status** - Always set to `draft` for new emails
- **email_type** - Set to `public` by default
- **slug** - Auto-generated from the title (lowercase, hyphenated)
- **created** - ISO timestamp when the file was created
- **modified** - ISO timestamp when the file was created (same as created initially)

## Filename Generation

The filename is generated from the title by:

1. Converting to lowercase
2. Replacing non-alphanumeric characters with hyphens
3. Removing leading and trailing hyphens

Examples:

```bash
--title="Hello World"           → hello-world.md
--title="My First Email!"       → my-first-email.md
--title="Weekly Update #42"     → weekly-update-42.md
--title="2024: Year in Review"  → 2024-year-in-review.md
```

## No Authentication Required

Unlike `pull` and `push`, the `create` command works entirely locally and doesn't require an API key or authentication:

```bash
# Works without logging in
$ buttondown create --title="Draft Post"
Created new draft email: ./buttondown/emails/draft-post.md
```

## Custom Directory

Create an email in a specific directory:

```bash
$ buttondown create --title="New Post" --directory=./my-newsletter
Created new draft email: ./my-newsletter/emails/new-post.md
```

## Error Handling

### Missing title

```bash
$ buttondown create
Error: --title is required for the create command
```

### Duplicate slug

If an email with the same slug already exists:

```bash
$ buttondown create --title="Welcome Email"
Created new draft email: ./buttondown/emails/welcome-email.md

$ buttondown create --title="Welcome Email"
Error: Email with slug "welcome-email" already exists at ./buttondown/emails/welcome-email.md
```

To create a different email with a similar title, modify the title slightly:

```bash
$ buttondown create --title="Welcome Email v2"
Created new draft email: ./buttondown/emails/welcome-email-v2.md
```

## Examples

### Create a simple draft

```bash
$ buttondown create --title="Weekly Update"
Created new draft email: ./buttondown/emails/weekly-update.md

$ cat ./buttondown/emails/weekly-update.md
---
subject: Weekly Update
status: draft
email_type: public
slug: weekly-update
created: 2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z
modified: 2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z
---

### Create and edit immediately

```bash
$ buttondown create --title="Product Launch Announcement"
Created new draft email: ./buttondown/emails/product-launch-announcement.md

$ vim ./buttondown/emails/product-launch-announcement.md
```

### Create in custom directory

```bash
$ buttondown create \
  --title="February Newsletter" \
  --directory=./newsletters/2024
Created new draft email: ./newsletters/2024/emails/february-newsletter.md
```

### Create with special characters

```bash
$ buttondown create --title="How to Use TypeScript (The Right Way!)"
Created new draft email: ./buttondown/emails/how-to-use-typescript-the-right-way.md
```

## Editing the Email

After creating an email, edit it with your preferred text editor:

```bash
$ buttondown create --title="New Post"
$ code ./buttondown/emails/new-post.md  # VS Code
$ vim ./buttondown/emails/new-post.md   # Vim
$ nano ./buttondown/emails/new-post.md  # Nano
```

## Adding Content

You can write standard Markdown in the email body:

```markdown
---
subject: My Newsletter
status: draft
email_type: public
slug: my-newsletter
created: 2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z
modified: 2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z

## Publishing Workflow

Complete workflow from creation to publishing:

```bash
# 1. Create a new draft
$ buttondown create --title="Weekly Update #1"
Created new draft email: ./buttondown/emails/weekly-update-1.md

# 2. Edit the email
$ vim ./buttondown/emails/weekly-update-1.md

# 3. Push to Buttondown
$ buttondown push
pushing
emails pushed: 0 updated, 1 created, 0 deleted, 0 failed

# 4. Change status to 'published' in Buttondown web interface
# Or edit the frontmatter locally and push again:
$ sed -i 's/status: draft/status: published/' ./buttondown/emails/weekly-update-1.md
$ buttondown push
pushing
emails pushed: 1 updated, 0 created, 0 deleted, 0 failed
```

## Best Practices

- **Descriptive titles** - Use clear, descriptive titles that will make good subjects
- **Unique titles** - Avoid duplicate titles to prevent slug conflicts
- **Edit before pushing** - Complete your draft locally before running `buttondown push`
- **Version control** - Use Git to track changes to your email drafts
- **Template emails** - Create a template email and duplicate/modify it for recurring newsletters

## Frontmatter Customization

After creation, you can manually edit the frontmatter to customize:

```markdown
---
subject: My Custom Email
status: draft              # draft, published, scheduled
email_type: public         # public, private
slug: custom-slug
publish_date: 2024-02-01T10:00:00Z  # For scheduled emails
secondary_id: 123          # Optional ID field
---
```
