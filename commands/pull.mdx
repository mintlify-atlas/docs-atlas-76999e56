The `pull` command downloads your newsletter content from Buttondown and saves it to a local directory.

## Usage

```bash
buttondown pull [options]
```

## What Gets Downloaded

The `pull` command downloads:

1. **Emails** - All your newsletter emails as Markdown files with frontmatter
2. **Media** - All uploaded images and files
3. **Automations** - Your automation sequences (if any)
4. **Newsletter settings** - Basic newsletter configuration
5. **Snippets** - Reusable content snippets

## Basic Example

```bash
$ buttondown pull
pulling
automations pulled: 0 updated, 2 created, 0 deleted, 0 failed
newsletter pulled: 1 updated, 0 created, 0 deleted, 0 failed
snippets pulled: 0 updated, 3 created, 0 deleted, 0 failed
images pulled: 0 updated, 5 created, 0 deleted, 0 failed
emails pulled: 0 updated, 12 created, 0 deleted, 0 failed
All content saved to: ./buttondown
```

## Options

<ParamField path="--api-key" type="string" shorthand="-k">
  Your Buttondown API key. Required if you haven't run `buttondown login`.
  
  If you've already logged in, the stored API key will be used automatically.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--base-url" type="string" shorthand="-b" default="https://api.buttondown.com/v1">
  The Buttondown API base URL.
  
  Only needed if you're using a self-hosted Buttondown instance or a custom API endpoint.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--directory" type="string" shorthand="-d" default="./buttondown">
  The directory where content will be saved.
  
  The CLI will create this directory if it doesn't exist, along with subdirectories for emails, media, etc.
</ParamField>

## Directory Structure

After running `pull`, your directory will look like:

```
buttondown/
├── emails/
│   ├── welcome-email.md
│   ├── weekly-update-1.md
│   └── weekly-update-2.md
├── media/
│   ├── header-image.png
│   └── screenshot.jpg
├── automations.json
├── newsletter.json
├── snippets.json
└── .buttondown-sync.json
```

### Email Files

Each email is saved as a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
subject: Welcome to my newsletter!
status: published
email_type: public
slug: welcome-email
publish_date: 2024-01-15T10:00:00Z
created: 2024-01-15T09:30:00Z
modified: 2024-01-15T10:00:00Z
---

Welcome! This is the body of your email.

![Header image](../media/header-image.png)
```

### Media Files

Images and other media are downloaded to the `media/` directory. Image URLs in email bodies are automatically converted to relative paths.

### Sync State

The `.buttondown-sync.json` file tracks which images have been synced. This file is used by the `push` command to avoid re-uploading unchanged media.

## Image URL Conversion

When pulling emails, absolute Buttondown image URLs are converted to relative paths:

```markdown
<!-- Remote URL in Buttondown -->
![Logo](https://buttondown-media.s3.amazonaws.com/abc123/logo.png)

<!-- Converted to relative path locally -->
![Logo](../media/logo.png)
```

This makes it easier to work with images locally and keeps your content portable.

## Authentication

The `pull` command requires authentication. You can provide your API key in two ways:

### Using stored credentials (recommended)

```bash
# First time: log in
$ buttondown login --api-key=your-api-key

# Then pull without specifying the key
$ buttondown pull
```

### Providing API key directly

```bash
$ buttondown pull --api-key=your-api-key
```

## Custom Directory

Pull content to a specific directory:

```bash
$ buttondown pull --directory=./my-newsletter
pulling
emails pulled: 0 updated, 12 created, 0 deleted, 0 failed
All content saved to: ./my-newsletter
```

## Operation Results

The pull command shows statistics for each resource type:

- **updated** - Existing local files that were modified
- **created** - New files downloaded
- **deleted** - Local files removed (if they no longer exist in Buttondown)
- **failed** - Operations that encountered errors

## Error Handling

### Missing API key

```bash
$ buttondown pull
Error: --api-key is required for the pull command, or run 'buttondown login' first
```

### Invalid API key

```bash
$ buttondown pull --api-key=invalid
Error: Authentication failed. Check your API key.
```

### Network errors

```bash
$ buttondown pull
Error: Failed to connect to Buttondown API. Check your internet connection.
```

## Examples

### First-time pull

```bash
$ buttondown login --api-key=bd_abc123
$ buttondown pull

images pulled: 0 updated, 3 created, 0 deleted, 0 failed
emails pulled: 0 updated, 5 created, 0 deleted, 0 failed
All content saved to: ./buttondown
```

```

### Pull to custom directory with custom API URL

```bash
$ buttondown pull \
  --directory=./newsletter-backup \
  --base-url=https://custom-buttondown.example.com/v1 \
  --api-key=bd_custom_key
```

## Next Steps

After pulling your content:

- Edit email files locally using your preferred text editor
- Run [buttondown create](/commands/create) to add new draft emails
- Run [buttondown push](/commands/push) to upload your changes back to Buttondown

## Best Practices

- **Pull before editing** - Always pull the latest content before making local changes to avoid conflicts
- **Regular syncs** - Pull regularly to stay in sync with changes made via the Buttondown web interface
- **Version control** - Consider using Git to track changes to your local newsletter content
- **Backup directory** - Use a custom directory for backups: `buttondown pull --directory=./backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)`
