description: Configure your Buttondown API key for authentication
---

The `login` command stores your Buttondown API key locally so you don't need to pass it with every command.

## Usage

```bash
buttondown login [options]
```

## Interactive Mode

Run `buttondown login` without flags to enter your API key interactively:

```bash
$ buttondown login
Please enter your Buttondown API key:
> your-api-key-here
✓ Successfully configured API key!
```

## Non-Interactive Mode

Provide your API key directly with the `--api-key` flag:

```bash
$ buttondown login --api-key=your-api-key
✓ Successfully configured API key!
```

## Options

<ParamField path="--api-key" type="string" shorthand="-k">
  Your Buttondown API key. If provided, skips the interactive prompt.
  
  Get your API key from [Settings → API](https://buttondown.com/settings/programming) in your Buttondown account.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--force" type="boolean" shorthand="-f" default={false}>
  Force re-login even if already authenticated. Use this to switch to a different API key.
</ParamField>

## Already Logged In

If you're already logged in, the command will let you know:

```bash
$ buttondown login
✓ You're already logged in!

To use a different API key, run: buttondown login --force
```

## Changing API Keys

To log in with a different API key, use the `--force` flag:

```bash
$ buttondown login --force
Please enter your Buttondown API key:
> new-api-key-here
✓ Successfully configured API key!
```

Or combine with `--api-key`:

```bash
$ buttondown login --force --api-key=new-api-key
✓ Successfully configured API key!
```

## Where is the API Key Stored?

Your API key is stored in your system's configuration directory using [Configstore](https://www.npmjs.com/package/configstore):

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Preferences/buttondown-cli-nodejs/`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/buttondown-cli-nodejs/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\buttondown-cli-nodejs\`

The API key is stored as plain text in this file. Keep your configuration directory secure.

## Security Best Practices

- Never commit your API key to version control
- Don't share your API key with others
- Rotate your API key regularly from [Buttondown settings](https://buttondown.com/settings/programming)
- If you suspect your key has been compromised, regenerate it immediately in Buttondown

## Error Handling

If the API key is empty or invalid:

```bash
$ buttondown login --api-key=""
API key cannot be empty
```

The `login` command validates that the key is not empty, but it doesn't verify the key with Buttondown. You'll discover if the key is invalid when you run `pull` or `push` commands.

## Examples

### First-time setup

```bash
$ buttondown login --api-key=bd_abcdef123456
✓ Successfully configured API key!

$ buttondown pull
pulling
emails pulled: 0 updated, 5 created, 0 deleted, 0 failed
```

### Switch accounts

```bash
$ buttondown login --force
Please enter your Buttondown API key:
> bd_different_account_key
✓ Successfully configured API key!
```

## Next Steps

After logging in:

- Run [buttondown pull](/commands/pull) to download your existing content
- Run [buttondown create](/commands/create) to start a new email
- Run [buttondown push](/commands/push) to upload local changes
