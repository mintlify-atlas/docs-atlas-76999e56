description: Clear stored credentials and log out
---

The `logout` command removes your stored API key and clears all local credentials.

## Usage

```bash
buttondown logout
```

## Example

```bash
$ buttondown logout
Logged out!
```

## What Gets Removed

The `logout` command clears your entire Buttondown CLI configuration, including:

- Your API key
- Your base URL (if customized)
- Any other stored settings

After logging out, you'll need to run `buttondown login` again before using commands that require authentication.

## No Options

The `logout` command doesn't accept any flags or options. It simply clears your stored credentials.

## When to Use Logout

You might want to log out when:

- Switching to a different Buttondown account
- Removing credentials from a shared machine
- Troubleshooting authentication issues
- Decommissioning a development environment

## After Logging Out

Commands that require authentication will fail:

```bash
$ buttondown logout
Logged out!

$ buttondown pull
Error: --api-key is required for the pull command, or run 'buttondown login' first
```

You can still use the `create` command since it doesn't require authentication:

```bash
$ buttondown create --title="Draft Post"
Created new draft email: ./buttondown/emails/draft-post.md
```

## Alternative: Using --force with login

If you just want to switch API keys, you don't need to log out first. Use `buttondown login --force` instead:

```bash
# No need to logout first
$ buttondown login --force --api-key=new-api-key
✓ Successfully configured API key!
```

## Configuration File Location

The logout command removes the configuration file from:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Preferences/buttondown-cli-nodejs/`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/buttondown-cli-nodejs/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\buttondown-cli-nodejs\`

## Next Steps

After logging out, you'll typically want to:

- Run [buttondown login](/commands/login) to authenticate with a different account
- Or simply close your terminal if you're done using the CLI
