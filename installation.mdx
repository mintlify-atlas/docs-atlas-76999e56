# Installation

Get started with Buttondown CLI by installing it globally or using it directly with npx.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Buttondown CLI, ensure you have:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Node.js 18 or higher">
    Buttondown CLI requires Node.js version 18 or higher. Check your version:
    
    ```bash
    node --version
    ```
    
    If you need to install or update Node.js, visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Buttondown Account">
    You'll need an active [Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/) account to use the CLI
  </Step>

  <Step title="API Key">
    Get your API key from your [Buttondown settings](https://buttondown.com/settings). You'll need this to authenticate the CLI
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Install Buttondown CLI

Choose your preferred package manager to install Buttondown CLI:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install -g @buttondown/cli
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add @buttondown/cli
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add -g @buttondown/cli
```

```bash bun
bun add -g @buttondown/cli
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  The `-g` flag installs the CLI globally, making the `buttondown` command available system-wide.
</Note>

## Using npx (No Installation)

If you prefer not to install the CLI globally, you can use it directly with npx:

```bash
px @buttondown/cli <command>
```

For example:

```bash
px @buttondown/cli login
px @buttondown/cli pull
```

<Warning>
  Using npx will download the CLI each time you run it, which may be slower than a global installation. For frequent use, we recommend installing globally.
</Warning>

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify that Buttondown CLI is installed correctly:

```bash
buttondown --version
```

This should display the current version number (e.g., `1.0.9`).

You can also view all available commands:

```bash
buttondown --help
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found

If you get a "command not found" error after global installation, your npm global bin directory may not be in your PATH. 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find your npm bin directory">
    ```bash
    npm bin -g
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add to your PATH">
    Add the output directory to your PATH in your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):
    
    ```bash
    export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/npm/bin"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reload your shell">
    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Permission Errors

If you encounter permission errors during installation with npm, you have a few options:

1. **Use npx instead** (no installation required)
2. **Fix npm permissions** following the [official npm guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally)
3. **Use a version manager** like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [volta](https://volta.sh/)
