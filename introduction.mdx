## Key Features

### Local-First Workflow

Edit your newsletters in Markdown format with YAML frontmatter. The CLI maintains a clean directory structure with separate folders for emails and media:

```
my-newsletter/
├── .buttondown.json  # Sync configuration
├── emails/           # Your emails as Markdown files
│   ├── newsletter-issue-1.md
│   └── newsletter-issue-2.md
└── media/            # Images and media files
    ├── image1.png
    └── document.pdf
```

### Seamless Sync

The CLI automatically tracks your content and media files, preventing duplicate uploads and ensuring consistency between your local files and Buttondown. All sync state is managed in `.buttondown.json`.

### Markdown with Frontmatter

Your emails are stored as standard Markdown files with YAML frontmatter for metadata:

```markdown
---
subject: My Newsletter Issue #1
status: draft
email_type: public
slug: newsletter-issue-1
publish_date: 2025-04-27T09:00:00Z
---

# My Newsletter Issue #1

Hello subscribers! This is the content of my email...
```

### Media Management

Upload images to Buttondown's media storage and reference them in your emails. The CLI handles image URLs and maintains a mapping between local files and remote URLs.
