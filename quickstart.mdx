# Quick Start

This guide will walk you through authenticating with Buttondown, pulling your content, making edits, and pushing changes back.

## Step 1: Authenticate

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run the login command">
    Start by authenticating with your Buttondown API key:
    
    ```bash
    buttondown login
    ```
    
    The CLI will prompt you to enter your API key interactively.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter your API key">
    Paste your API key when prompted. You can find your API key in your [Buttondown settings](https://buttondown.com/settings).
    
    ```
    Please enter your Buttondown API key:
    > your-api-key-here
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm authentication">
    Once authenticated, you'll see a success message:
    
    ```
    ✓ Successfully configured API key!
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  You can also provide your API key directly using the `--api-key` flag:
  
  ```bash
  buttondown login --api-key=your-api-key
  ```
</Note>

### Updating Your API Key

If you need to change your API key, use the `--force` flag:

```bash
buttondown login --force
```

## Step 2: Pull Your Content

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pull content from Buttondown">
    Download all your emails and media files:
    
    ```bash
    buttondown pull
    ```
    
    By default, this creates a `./buttondown` directory in your current location.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the downloaded content">
    The CLI will show you what was synced:
    
    ```
    newsletter pulled: 1 updated, 0 created, 0 deleted, 0 failed
    emails pulled: 12 updated, 0 created, 0 deleted, 0 failed
    images pulled: 8 updated, 0 created, 0 deleted, 0 failed
    All content saved to: ./buttondown
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Explore the directory structure">
    Check out your local newsletter files:
    
    ```bash
    cd buttondown
    ls -la
    ```
    
    You'll see:
    - `.buttondown.json` - Sync state and configuration
    - `emails/` - Your newsletters as Markdown files
    - `media/` - Downloaded images and attachments
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  You can specify a custom directory:
  
  ```bash
  buttondown pull --directory=./my-newsletter
  ```
</Note>

## Step 3: Edit Your Content

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open an email file">
    Navigate to the emails directory and open any `.md` file in your favorite editor:
    
    ```bash
    cd emails
    vim newsletter-issue-1.md  # or use any editor
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the email format">
    Your email will have YAML frontmatter followed by Markdown content:
    
    ```markdown
    ---
    subject: My Newsletter Issue #1
    status: draft
    email_type: public
    slug: newsletter-issue-1
    publish_date: 2025-04-27T09:00:00Z
    created: 2025-04-25T15:32:18Z
    modified: 2025-04-26T10:45:22Z
    ---
    
    # My Newsletter Issue #1
    
    Hello subscribers!
    
    This is the content of my email...
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make your changes">
    Edit the content, subject, or any metadata you want to update. Save the file when you're done.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Don't modify the `id` field in the frontmatter - this is used to match your local file with the remote email on Buttondown.
</Warning>

## Step 4: Create a New Email (Optional)

You can create new draft emails locally:

```bash
buttondown create --title="My New Newsletter" --directory=./buttondown
```

This creates a new Markdown file with the proper frontmatter structure:

```markdown
---
subject: My New Newsletter
status: draft
email_type: public
slug: my-new-newsletter
created: 2026-02-28T10:30:00Z
modified: 2026-02-28T10:30:00Z
---

Write your email content here...
```

## Step 5: Add Media

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add images to the media folder">
    Copy any images you want to use into the `media/` directory:
    
    ```bash
    cp ~/Downloads/my-image.png buttondown/media/
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reference images in your emails">
    After pushing (next step), images are uploaded to Buttondown. You can then reference them using either:
    
    - Relative paths: `![Alt text](../media/my-image.png)`
    - Absolute URLs: `![Alt text](https://buttondown.s3.amazonaws.com/images/...)`
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 6: Push Your Changes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Push to Buttondown">
    Upload your changes back to Buttondown:
    
    ```bash
    buttondown push
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the sync results">
    The CLI shows what was uploaded:
    
    ```
    newsletter pushed: 0 updated, 0 created, 0 deleted, 0 failed
    emails pushed: 2 updated, 1 created, 0 deleted, 0 failed
    images pushed: 1 updated, 0 created, 0 deleted, 0 failed
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify on Buttondown">
    Log in to your [Buttondown dashboard](https://buttondown.com/emails) to see your updated content.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The push command is smart - it only uploads files that have changed since the last sync.
</Note>

## Common Workflows

### Version Control with Git

Track your newsletter content with Git:

```bash
cd buttondown
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial newsletter backup"
```

### Regular Backups

Set up a cron job or scheduled task to automatically pull your content:

```bash
# Add to crontab (daily at 2am)
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/buttondown && buttondown pull
```

### Team Collaboration

1. One team member pulls content: `buttondown pull`
2. Commit to Git: `git add . && git commit -m "Update newsletter"`
3. Push to remote: `git push origin main`
4. Other team members pull from Git: `git pull`
5. When ready, push to Buttondown: `buttondown push`
