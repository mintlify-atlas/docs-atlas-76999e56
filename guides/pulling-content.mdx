description: Learn how to sync your Buttondown newsletter content to local files
---

The `pull` command downloads your newsletter content from Buttondown and saves it to local files, making it easy to work with your content offline or integrate with version control.

## How Pull Works

When you run `buttondown pull`, the CLI performs a synchronized workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pull Base Resources">
    Downloads automations, newsletter settings, and snippets from the Buttondown API and saves them as local files.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Pull and Download Images">
    Fetches all images from your media library and downloads them to the `media/` directory. The CLI builds a mapping between remote URLs and local file paths.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Pull Emails with Image Conversion">
    Downloads all emails and automatically converts absolute image URLs to relative paths that reference your local `media/` directory.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Write Sync State">
    Saves a `.buttondown-sync.json` file that tracks which images have been synced, enabling efficient future pushes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Basic Usage

Pull all content from your newsletter:

```bash
buttondown pull
```

This creates the following directory structure:

```
my-newsletter/
├── emails/           # All your newsletter emails as .md files
├── media/            # Downloaded images from your media library
├── automations/      # Automation configurations as .json files
├── snippets/         # Reusable content snippets as .md files
├── newsletter.json   # Newsletter settings
└── .buttondown-sync.json  # Sync state (tracks image mappings)
```

## What Gets Pulled

### Emails

Emails are saved as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown emails/welcome-email.md
---
id: abc123
subject: Welcome to our newsletter!
email_type: public
status: draft
slug: welcome-email
publish_date: 2024-03-15T10:00:00Z
---

Hello and welcome!

![Welcome image](../media/welcome.png)
```

<Note>
Absolute image URLs from Buttondown are automatically converted to relative paths pointing to your local `media/` directory.
</Note>

### Media

All images from your Buttondown media library are downloaded to `media/` with their original filenames:

```
media/
├── header-logo.png
├── welcome-banner.jpg
└── footer-icon.svg
```

### Automations

Automations are saved as JSON files named by their slugified name:

```json automations/welcome-series.json
{
  "id": "auto123",
  "name": "Welcome Series",
  "status": "active",
  "trigger": {
    "type": "subscriber_created"
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "send_email",
      "delay": 0,
      "email_id": "welcome-001"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Snippets

Snippets are saved as Markdown files with frontmatter:

```markdown snippets/footer.md
---
id: snip123
name: Standard Footer
---

Thanks for reading!

Unsubscribe: {{ unsubscribe_url }}
```

### Newsletter Settings

Your newsletter configuration is saved as `newsletter.json`:

```json newsletter.json
{
  "name": "My Newsletter",
  "description": "Weekly insights on technology",
  "author": "Jane Doe",
  "email_address": "hello@example.com"
}
```

## Understanding Image Conversion

The pull command intelligently handles images:

1. **Remote URLs to Local Paths**: Images referenced in emails like `https://buttondown.s3.amazonaws.com/images/abc123.png` are converted to relative paths like `../media/abc123.png`

2. **Sync State Tracking**: The `.buttondown-sync.json` file maintains a mapping:

```json .buttondown-sync.json
{
  "syncedImages": {
    "img_abc123": {
      "id": "img_abc123",
      "localPath": "/path/to/my-newsletter/media/header.png",
      "url": "https://buttondown.s3.amazonaws.com/images/header.png",
      "filename": "header.png"
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Relative Paths**: Email content is updated so you can reference images locally:

```markdown
<!-- Before pull (remote) -->
![Logo](https://buttondown.s3.amazonaws.com/images/logo.png)

<!-- After pull (local) -->
![Logo](../media/logo.png)
```

<Tip>
This conversion allows you to edit emails offline and preview images locally before pushing changes back to Buttondown.
